   The US Supreme Court building serves as the official residence of the Chief Justice of the US and the eight Associate justices. It is the final court of appeals in the justice system. It was built from October 13, 1932 to April 4, 1935. Many famous cases were heard here, like Dred Scott v. Sandford and Marbury v. Madison.
