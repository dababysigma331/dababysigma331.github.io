      The Capitol is home to congress
      and is located at the eastern end of Pennsylvania Ave, on Capitol Hill. It was built from September 18, 1783 to November 17, 1800. President George Washington selected the area. Dr. William Thornton designed the building. The statue of freedom is on top of the building. This was where the riots of Jan 6 took place.
