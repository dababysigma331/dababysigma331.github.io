The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery is a historic funerary monument dedicated to deceased U.S. service members whose remains remain unidentified. Since 1921, it has provided a final resting place for one of Americaâ€™s unidentified World War I service members, and Unknowns from later wars were added in 1958 and 1984. This iconic memorial stands as a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by countless soldiers in defense of their country. It was built between Dec 1931 and finished on April 9, 1932.
